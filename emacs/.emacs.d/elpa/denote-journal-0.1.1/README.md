# Denote Journal extras

The `denote-journal` package makes it easier to use Denote for
journaling. While it is possible to use the generic `denote` command
(and related) to maintain a journal, this package defines extra
functionality to streamline the journaling workflow.

The code of `denote-journal` used to be bundled up with the `denote`
package before version `4.0.0` of the latter and was available in the
file `denote-journal-extras.el`. Users of the old code will need to
adapt their setup to use the `denote-journal` package. This can be
done by replacing all instances of `denote-journal-extras` with
`denote-journal` across their configuration.
