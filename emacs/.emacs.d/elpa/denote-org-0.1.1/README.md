# denote-org: Extras to integrate Org mode with Denote (like Org dynamic blocks)

The `denote-org` package contains extra features that better integrate
Denote with Org mode. These used to be available as part of the main
`denote` package in a file called `denote-org-extras.el`, but now live
in this standalone package to main things easier to maintain and
understand.

With `denote-org`, users have Org-specific extensions such as dynamic
blocks, links to headings, and splitting an Org subtree into its own
standalone file. This package's official manual covers the
technicalities.
